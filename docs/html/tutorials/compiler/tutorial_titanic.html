<p>Once the PoC is done (and you know where your data comes from, what it looks like, and what it can predict) comes the ideal next step is to put your model into production and make it useful for the rest of the business.</p>
<p>Does it sound familiar? do you also need to answer the questions below, before promoting your model into production: 1. <em>How you sure that your model is ready for production?</em> 2. <em>How you able to explain the model performance? in business context that non-technical management can understand?</em> 3. <em>How you able to compare between newly trained models and existing models is done manually every iteration?</em></p>
<p>In Contextual AI project, our simply vision is to: 1. <strong>Speed up data validation</strong> 2. <strong>Simplify model engineering</strong> 3. <strong>Build trust</strong></p>
