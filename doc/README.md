# XAI Documentation
XAI documentation is automatically generated by Sphinx. Here are the steps to regenerate them.

- Install Sphinx and other required packages in requirements.txt in this doc folder.
- Install a stand-alone program pandoc (NOT the python package with the same name) using 
'conda install -c conda-forge pandoc' if you have conda, otherwise refer to http://pandoc.org/installing.html.
- Go to folder doc and run ./apidoc.sh to generate latest HTML documentation.
- Your documentation entry point is doc/build/html/index.html



# Developer Guide

XAI libraries consist of multiple modules (data, evaluation, explainer and formatter as of 1909). 
Developers of XAI are recommended to follow the same structure and documentation style when extending the library.


### Structure Guideline
- Each module provides a set of closely related classes/functions 
packed in the same package under xai (e.g. xai/explainer/), 
which aim to address similar types of problems encountered in the same stage of ML piplelines.
- Each module should come with a README.md file in the root of its source package (e.g. xai/explain/README.md),
describing its main features and capabilities. 
- Optionally the module can include its own requirements.txt file stating the dependencies to run the module alone.
- Each module should provide some tutorials demonstrating is typical use case scenarios.
The tutorials are recommended to be presented in the format of Jupyter notebooks. 
A README.md file should be included to briefly introduce how to run the notebooks and what each notebook does.
- All tutorials related files (including README.md and *.ipynb) should be put under the same folder in tutorials 
(e.g. tutorials/explainer/).

### Style Guideline
- All source codes should be properly documented following Google Python Style 
(http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
- README.md files should be written with proper heading levels:
 a single level 1 heading (annotated with #) and multiple level 2 or 3 headings if necessary.
 Refer to xai/explainer/README.md for your reference.
- Jupyter notebooks should follow proper heading levels too: 
 a single level 1 heading and more sub-levels if necessary.
 Refer to tutorials/explainer/lime_text_explainer.ipynb for your reference.
- Images in Jupyter notebooks should be inserted using markdown script
(e.g. `![Report Header](images/sample-report-header.png)`), html `<img>` tag is not supported.
- Due to current library limitations, Juypter notebooks from different tutorials will be extracted to 
the same root folder during intermediate steps. If a notebook has any folder containing referenced images, the folder
must have unique names globally across all tutorials. 
Thus it is recommended to prefix your image folder with the module name.
