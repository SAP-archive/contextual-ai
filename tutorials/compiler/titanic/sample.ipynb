    "# Generate Explainable Report with Titanic dataset using XAI\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to generate explanations report using complier implemented in the XAI library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Once the PoC is done (and you know where your data comes from, what it looks like, and what it can predict) comes the ideal next step is to put your model into production and make it useful for the rest of the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does it sound familiar? do you also need to answer the questions below, before promoting your model into production:\n",
    "1. _How you sure that your model is ready for production?_\n",
    "2. _How you able to explain the model performance? in business context that non-technical management can understand?_\n",
    "3. _How you able to compare between newly trained models and existing models is done manually every iteration?_\n",
    "\n",
    "In XAI project, our simply vision is to:\n",
    "1. __Speed up data validation__\n",
    "2. __Simplify model engineering__\n",
    "3. __Build trust__  \n",
    "  \n",
    "For more details, please refer to our [whitepaper](https://sap.sharepoint.com/sites/100454/ML_Apps/Shared%20Documents/Reusable%20Components/Explainability/XAI_Whitepaper.pdf?csf=1&e=phIUNN&cid=771297d7-d488-441a-8a65-dab0305c3f04)\n",

    "## Steps\n",
    "1. Create a model to Predict survival on the Titanic, using the data provide in [titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\n",
